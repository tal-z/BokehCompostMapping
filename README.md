# BokehCompostMapping
This is a script for generating a Bokeh map of some proprietary data which will not be shared here. 

The bones of this script can be used in future Bokeh mapping projects, which are good for streaming data and a high degree of interactivity. 

This will perhaps find its way into a django project.
